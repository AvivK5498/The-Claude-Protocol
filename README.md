## Why

Claude Code loses context. Plans disappear after compaction. Tasks are forgotten between sessions. Changes go straight to main with no traceability.

Claude Protocol fixes this with three things:

- **Beads** — persistent task tracking. One task = one worktree = one PR. Survives restarts and compaction.
- **Hooks** — enforcement, not instructions. Edits on main are blocked. Completion without checklist is blocked. `git --no-verify` is blocked.
- **Knowledge base** — every LEARNED comment is captured automatically and surfaced at session start.

Constraints over instructions. What's blocked can't be ignored.

## Origin

This project started as a fork of [The Claude Protocol](https://github.com/AvivK5498/The-Claude-Protocol) by Aviv Kaplan. The original author appears to have stopped development — PRs go unreviewed, and the underlying tools (beads CLI, Claude Code hooks API) have changed significantly.

v3 is a ground-up rewrite. Different architecture, different philosophy. See [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) for full rationale.

## What Changed in v3

Stripped everything that doesn't improve output. Added everything that does.

**Removed:**
- 5 specialized agents (Scout, Detective, Architect, Scribe, Discovery) — duplicated built-in Claude Code capabilities
- Per-tech supervisor generation — 500+ lines of context per stack, Claude already knows these technologies
- Agent personas ("Rex the reviewer") — based on outdated prompting patterns, just fills context
- MCP Provider Delegator, Kanban UI, Web Interface Guidelines — unnecessary infrastructure
- 19 bash hooks — replaced with 8 cross-platform Node.js hooks

**Added:**
- Checklist verification — hook blocks completion if requirements from description aren't checked off
- Session-start dashboard — shows open tasks, merged PRs awaiting cleanup, stale beads, recent knowledge
- Mandatory size check — automatic decision: single bead or epic with children
- Plan-to-beads requirement — all planned tasks must be created as beads before implementation starts
- LEARNED quality enforcement — specific format: problem → solution → context
- Safe merge into existing projects — CLAUDE.md appended, settings.json hooks merged, nothing overwritten
- bd command reference in rules — prevents Claude from inventing nonexistent commands

**Changed:**
- Rules are trigger-based ("when you create an API endpoint → add logging") instead of reference documents
- Knowledge base search is mandatory before every investigation
- Dev rules (implementation, logging, TDD) included by default

## How It Works

### What gets installed

```
.claude/
  agents/
    code-reviewer.md        # Adversarial 3-phase review
    merge-supervisor.md     # Conflict resolution protocol
  hooks/                    # 8 Node.js enforcement hooks
  rules/
    beads-workflow.md       # Task lifecycle, bd command reference
    implementation-standard.md
    logging-standard.md
    tdd-workflow.md
  skills/
    project-discovery/      # Extracts project conventions
  settings.json             # Hook configuration
CLAUDE.md                   # Orchestrator instructions
.beads/                     # Task database + knowledge base
```

### Safe for existing projects

- **CLAUDE.md** — if it exists, beads section is appended. Original content preserved.
- **settings.json** — hooks are merged by event type. Your existing hooks stay.
- **.gitignore** — missing entries appended. Nothing removed.

### What happens at session start

Every time you start Claude Code, the `session-start` hook shows:

- **ACTION REQUIRED** — merged worktrees with unclosed beads, stale `inreview` tasks
- **In Progress** — beads to resume
- **Ready** — unblocked beads available for dispatch
- **Blocked / Stale** — beads waiting on dependencies or inactive for 3+ days
- **Recent Knowledge** — last 5 LEARNED entries from the knowledge base
- **Open PRs** — your PRs awaiting review

No manual checking. Context is rebuilt automatically.

### Project discovery

After installation, run `/project-discovery` in Claude Code. It scans your codebase and writes `.claude/rules/project-conventions.md` with:

- Tech stack and frameworks detected
- Naming conventions and patterns
- Testing setup and commands
- Anti-patterns specific to your project

This file is auto-loaded into every agent context. No per-tech supervisor generation needed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- git

### Install

```bash
npx claude-protocol init
```

Restart Claude Code. Run `/project-discovery`.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project-dir PATH` | Target directory (default: current) |
| `--project-name NAME` | Project name for CLAUDE.md (auto-inferred from package.json / pyproject.toml / Cargo.toml / go.mod) |
| `--no-rules` | Skip dev rules (implementation-standard, logging-standard, tdd-workflow) |

### Local development (before npm publish)

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-protocol && npm link
npx claude-protocol init  # works in any project
```

## Workflow

### Every task goes through beads

```
Plan → Size check → Create beads → bd ready → Dispatch → Worktree → PR → Merge → Close
```

**Size check** runs automatically before creating beads:
- More than 3 files or multiple domains (DB + API + frontend) → epic with children
- More than 50 lines estimated → consider splitting
- Otherwise → single bead

One bead = one worktree = one PR = one reviewable diff.

### Parallel work

```bash
bd dep add TASK-2 TASK-1    # TASK-2 is blocked by TASK-1
bd close TASK-1              # TASK-2 becomes ready
bd ready                     # shows all unblocked tasks
```

Orchestrator dispatches all ready tasks in parallel via `Task()`.

### Quick fix

For changes under 10 lines on a feature branch. Hard blocked on main.

```bash
git checkout -b fix-typo     # must be off main
# edit → hook asks for confirmation → commit
```

### Completion verification

Subagents are blocked from finishing unless:
- `Checklist:` section present with all `[x]` items checked
- Bead status set to `inreview`
- Code committed and pushed
- Comment left on bead
- Response within verbosity limits (25 lines / 1200 chars)

## Hooks

| Hook | Event | Enforcement |
|------|-------|-------------|
| enforce-branch-before-edit | PreToolUse (Edit/Write) | Blocks edits on main. Asks confirmation on feature branches with file name and change size. |
| bash-guard | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks `--no-verify`. Requires description on `bd create`. Validates epic close (all children done, PR merged). |
| validate-completion | SubagentStop | Checks worktree, push, status, checklist, comment, verbosity. |
| memory-capture | PostToolUse (Bash) | Extracts LEARNED entries → `.beads/memory/knowledge.jsonl` with auto-tags. |
| session-start | SessionStart | Surfaces tasks, merged PRs, knowledge, ACTION REQUIRED reminders. |
| nudge-claude-md-update | PreCompact | Reminds to update CLAUDE.md before context compaction. |
| hook-utils | — | Shared utilities: getField, parseBeadId, deny/ask/block, execCommand. |
| recall | — | Knowledge base search: `node .beads/memory/recall.cjs "keyword"`. |

## Dev Rules

Included by default. Skip with `--no-rules`.

| Rule | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| implementation-standard | Dev process with user confirmation. Code metrics (function < 30 lines, class < 200, nesting < 4). Self-review with `/simplify` trigger. |
| logging-standard | Trigger-based: "creating API endpoint → add logging". Covers external calls, payments, auth, background jobs. Sentry + Seq. |
| tdd-workflow | Trigger-based: "new function → write test first". RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle. Clear exceptions (configs, DTOs, migrations). |

## FAQ

**Q: `bd init` hangs during installation.**
A: Dolt server is not running. Bootstrap creates `.beads/` manually after 15s timeout. Run `bd init` later when Dolt is available, or use SQLite backend.

**Q: Hooks don't work after installation.**
A: Restart Claude Code. Hooks load from `settings.json` at startup.

**Q: Claude invents commands like `bd export`.**
A: `beads-workflow.md` includes a full command reference table. If Claude still invents commands, it didn't read the rules — check that `.claude/rules/` exists.

**Q: Will this overwrite my CLAUDE.md?**
A: No. If CLAUDE.md exists, beads section is appended with a separator. Original content stays.

**Q: Can I use this without Dolt?**
A: Yes. Beads works with SQLite by default. Dolt adds version history and branching for the task database.
